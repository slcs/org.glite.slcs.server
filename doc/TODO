TODO:
----
- read the org.glite.slcs.filter.AttributesAuthorizationFilter 
  configuration parameters from SLCSServerConfiguration file and
  not from the FilterConfig anymore. because web.xml is in the 
  war file and can not be modified before deployment...
  -> add AtttributesAuthorizationFilter element in slcs.xml file
  
- how to load log4j.xml (context param) for the filter logging too?

- implement a clean and full auditor.

- solution to display audit event for all group the admin belongs to.
